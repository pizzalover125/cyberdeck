I have had this idea for a while, but never got around to do it. Now is the perfect time! My plan is to make a basic cyberdeck with the Latte Panda Mu. I did a lot of research about how I will actually accomplish this. I found https://cyberdeck.cafe/build, and will follow some of that advice. I'll begin with looking at the full carrier board made by Latte Panda and try to understand how it works. Then I'll build a custom carrier board with the items of my choice.

Sadly, this project must come to an end, mainly due to costs and tariffs. I'll probably pursue this without the help of Hack Club at a later date.

SIKE!!! Got you there, didn't I. Ok in all seriousness, I'll still try to build this. Today, I just did a bunch of research on how to bring the cost down. At the end, I came up with these two things (majority of cost):

I did a LOT more research. I never expected that this type of project would require this many hours of research. I'll stick with the MakerFocus battery and circuit. I unfortunately couldn't find an CAD file for that board that works, which is not ideal. I also want to go with the Waveshare 7 inch screen as it will offer better battery efficiency. So I'll have to end up designing a USB hub, a keyboard, and an enclosure for this project.

Okay time to revamp this project. I was originally wanting to make an ultra version of the Sprig. I decided to make it modular because thats just cool. I couldn't do much work because it was quite late at night. So... I just made a mockup in ExcaliDraw! Here it is:

I literally worked on this project the entire project today... First, I did some research. It was actually super easy to do. I'm using these small speakers that @alexren recommended. To power these, I also got two MAX98735A speaker drivers. It was at this moment I decided to make this project as cheap as possible. This is why I did not create any PCBs and used cheap modules instead. Then I found this cheap USB hub breakout on Adafruit's website, so I decided to go with it. I also found these ultra cheap USB-A breakouts on Amazon for less than a buck a pop. Finally, for this ultra cheap version, I'll use the Raspberry Pi 02w. Then I made the CAD. It was actually super hard as I'm pretty bad at CAD. It was a matter of finding the 3D models online, importing them, positioning them, and then creating mounting holes. This took a SUPER long time. Finally I got this:

After that, I decided to reposition everything to be able to fit the Raspberry Pi 5. I kind of got the hang of it and was far faster. I also couldn't find a 3d model of the display driver, so I had to make my own. Here is what I got:

Today, I did not get much progress done. I was trying to figure out the best way to get audio. Turns out my janky solution from before was just too impractical. I researched and researched but got nothing. Then someone told me I could just use a TRRS USB to audio converter... that helps a lot! However, I haven't decided how I'm going to route the actual module yet. I, for some reason, decided to route wires instead:

Today was also a slow day. I decided to start making the modules. But turns out that the Waveshare RP2040-1s don't have KiCad files. I tried converting EasyEDA files to KiCad, but it did not output THT. So... I just have to use EasyEDA ðŸ˜­. Its super hard to use and I just strongly dislike it. Howver, desperate times call for desperate measures. I gotted this draft of a schematic:

I finished the joycon modules today. But for some reason exporting to 3d in EasyEDA Std is terrible. So I had to migrate my project to PRO. However, when I exported, all the dimensions were wrong for some reason... so I'll just have to do what it outputted. Hopefully nothing goes wrong in production. Here are the right and left joycons:

I also made the schematic for the bottom keyboard / trackpad combo. Having enough space will be next to impossible, so I will have to make it wider most likely.

Today, I wrapped up the project. omg its been soooooooooooooooooooo long. I've put in so much effort, so its nice to see it paid off. I was working on this project AFK at this national speech and debate tournament, so I didn't journal those days. Here is an interesting view of the product: <br>
