I have had this idea for a while, but never got around to do it. Now is the perfect time! My plan is to make a basic cyberdeck with the Latte Panda Mu. I did a lot of research about how I will actually accomplish this. I found https://cyberdeck.cafe/build, and will follow some of that advice. I'll begin with looking at the full carrier board made by Latte Panda and try to understand how it works. Then I'll build a custom carrier board with the items of my choice.

Sadly, this project must come to an end, mainly due to costs and tariffs. I'll probably pursue this without the help of Hack Club at a later date.
