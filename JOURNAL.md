I have had this idea for a while, but never got around to do it. Now is the perfect time! My plan is to make a basic cyberdeck with the Latte Panda Mu. I did a lot of research about how I will actually accomplish this. I found https://cyberdeck.cafe/build, and will follow some of that advice. I'll begin with looking at the full carrier board made by Latte Panda and try to understand how it works. Then I'll build a custom carrier board with the items of my choice.

Sadly, this project must come to an end, mainly due to costs and tariffs. I'll probably pursue this without the help of Hack Club at a later date.

SIKE!!! Got you there, didn't I. Ok in all seriousness, I'll still try to build this. Today, I just did a bunch of research on how to bring the cost down. At the end, I came up with these two things (majority of cost):

I did a LOT more research. I never expected that this type of project would require this many hours of research. I'll stick with the MakerFocus battery and circuit. I unfortunately couldn't find an CAD file for that board that works, which is not ideal. I also want to go with the Waveshare 7 inch screen as it will offer better battery efficiency. So I'll have to end up designing a USB hub, a keyboard, and an enclosure for this project.
